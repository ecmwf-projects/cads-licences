**Data lineage**
Data were processed by the ESA CCI Sea Ice project team.
 
Contribution of the EUMETSAT OSI SAF to the production of this dataset is acknowledged. EUMETSAT OSI SAF provided access and allowed re-use of its SIC reprocessing software and data hosting facilities. The reprocessing chain was further updated with the new algorithms and knowledge from the ESA CCI Sea Ice project.

This dataset is originally published on the CCI Data Portal.



**Terms and Conditions for use of Sea Ice CCI datasets.**


The CCI datasets may be used by any user for any purpose, with the following terms and conditions:

1) Users of the CCI data are required to acknowledge the ESA Climate Change Initiative and the Sea Ice CCI project together with the individual data providers if the data are used in a presentation or publication. Please also cite any relevant dataset DOIs. (See example citation text below.)

2) Users of the CCI data are encouraged to interact with the CCI programme on use of the products, and to provide a copy of all reports and publications using the dataset. An offer of co-authorship should be considered, if the CCI data constitute a major component of a scientific publication.

3) Intellectual property rights (IPR) in the CCI data lie with the researchers and organisations
producing the data.

4) Liability: No warranty is given as to the quality or the accuracy of the CCI data or its suitability for any use. All implied conditions relating to the quality or suitability of the information, and all liabilities arising from the supply of the information (including any liability arising in negligence) are excluded to the fullest extent permitted by law.

## Terms of use agreement for CORDEX model output


The Coordinated Regional climate Downscaling Experiment CORDEX (www.cordex.org) is an international coordinated effort under the auspices of the World Climate Research Programme's Working Group on Regional Climate to provide homogeneously designed regional climate model output to users. 

WCRP encourages modelling groups to provide their CORDEX data for both commercial and research purposes, but modelling centres may decide to restrict the use of their data to “non-commercial research and educational purposes.” Users registering to access CORDEX output will be granted access to some or all of the data, depending on their affiliation. They have to agree to one of the following terms of use:

**Terms of use for CORDEX data for non-commercial research and educational purposess**

     a) I agree to restrict my use of CORDEX model output for non-commercial research and educational purposes only. 

     Results from non-commercial research are expected to be made generally available through open publication and must not be considered proprietary. Materials prepared for educational purposes cannot be sold. These restrictions may only be relaxed by permission of the individual modelling groups responsible for the simulations.   

***OR***

**Terms of use for CORDEX data for commercial purposes (unrestricted use)**

     a) I understand that the subset of CORDEX model output that will be made accessible to this group has been designated for "unrestricted" use. 

**For both groups of users, the terms of use include these additional statements:** 

     b) I will hold no individual(s), organization(s), or group(s) responsible for any errors in the models or in their output data. 

     c) In publications that rely on the CORDEX model output, I will appropriately credit the data providers by an acknowledgment similar to the following: 

        We acknowledge the World Climate Research Programme's Working Group on Regional Climate, and the Working Group on Coupled Modelling, former coordinating body of CORDEX and responsible panel for CMIP5. We also thank the climate modelling groups (listed in Table XX of this paper) for producing and making available their model output. We also acknowledge the Earth SystemGrid Federation infrastructure an international effort led by the U.S. Department of Energy's Program for Climate Model Diagnosis and Intercomparison, the European Network for Earth System Modelling and other partners in the Global Organisation for Earth System Science Portals (GO-ESSP).
    
    where "Table XX" in your paper should list the models and modelling groups that provided the data you used.

	 d) I acknowledge the potential limitations of the data obtained from this archive. These may include (but are not necessarily limited to) errors in the models, shortcomings in the experiment designs, the conjectural quality of the forcing scenarios used to drive the models, and statistical uncertainty of model results.

     e) I understand that although the model output has been subjected to a quality control procedure, unrecognized errors almost certainly remain.

     f) To aid participating groups in understanding and improving upon their models’ behaviours, I will respond to reasonable requests from the WGCM or from CORDEX data providers for feedback about my CORDEX research results (e.g., reporting model deficiencies, recording CORDEX publications, etc.).
    
     g) I understand that Digital Object Identifiers (DOI’s used, for example, in journal citations) together with a citation reference will be assigned to some of the CORDEX datasets during the DataCite data publication process, and when available and as appropriate, I will cite CORDEX data by these citation references in my publications. I will consult the CORDEX website (www.cordex.org) to learn how to do this.

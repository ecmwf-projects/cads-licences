**Data Citation and Policies (https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/data/data-citation-and-policies/)**

_Data Access_

All data products distributed by NASA&#39;s Land Processes Distributed Active Archive Center (LP DAAC) are available at no charge.

_Data Redistribution_

All LP DAAC current data and products acquired through the LP DAAC have no restrictions on reuse, sale, or redistribution.

ASTER GDEM Version 3 (https://doi.org/10.5067/ASTER/ASTGTM.003) was released on August, 5, 2019 and contains no redistribution requirements. The LP DAAC kindly requests that you properly cite the data in your research. Pre-populated citations for the product can be found on the DOI Landing Page ([https://doi.org/10.5067/ASTER/ASTGTM.003](https://doi.org/10.5067/ASTER/ASTGTM.003)) for the product under the &quot;Citation&quot; section. Users are encouraged to use ASTER GDEM Version 3 going forward as ASTER GDEM Version 2 data are no longer available from the LP DAAC.

Previously ASTER GDEM Version 2 (https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/products/astgtmv002/) data required users to agree to only redistribute data products to individuals within their organization or project of intended use, or in response to disasters in support of the GEO Disaster Theme (http://www.earthobservations.org/index.php) prior to downloading data. In addition, the following sentence was required to be included in publications that used the data: &quot;ASTER GDEM is a product of Japan&#39;s Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry (METI) and NASA.&quot; Projects that are continuing to use ASTER GDEM Version 2 data are required to continue following these redistribution and citation requirements. &quot;

_Data and Data Tool Citation_

The LP DAAC would appreciate receiving an electronic copy of your publication via DOI link and hearing about your work using data and tools from our website. Please feel free to contact us ([https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/lpdaac-contact-us/](https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/lpdaac-contact-us/)) to tell us about your research. Your input will help us stay informed about data use and may be highlighted as a use case of the data.

- _How do I cite a NASA data product?_

The LP DAAC requests that any author using NASA data products in their work provide credit for the data, and any assistance provided by the LP DAAC, in the data section of the paper, the acknowledgement section, and/or as a reference. The recommended citation for each data product is available on its Digital Object Identifier (DOI) Landing page, which can be accessed through the Search Data Catalog (https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/product\_search/) interface.

- _How do I cite a NASA data tool?_

Tools that have recommended citations are provided on the individual tool page that can be found on the Tools Landing page (https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/tools/). Note: AppEEARS will also include a pre-filled out citation in the email that is sent to you upon completion of processing.

- _How do I cite information or images obtained from the LP DAAC website?_

If you obtained information or an image from the LP DAAC website, for instance from Outreach Materials, then we request that you provide information that can direct your reader to the LP DAAC website. For example:

_ASTER Mount Gariwang image from 2018 was retrieved on YYYY\_MM\_DD from https://lpdaac.usgs.gov, maintained by the NASA EOSDIS Land Processes Distributed Active Archive Center (LP DAAC) at the USGS Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS) Center, Sioux Falls, South Dakota. 2018,_[https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/resources/data-action/aster-ultimate-2018-winter-olympics-observer/](https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/user_resources/data_in_action/aster_ultimate_2018_winter_olympics_observer)_._

If you have any questions regarding data access, redistribution, or citation, please contact our user services team ([https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/lpdaac-contact-us/](https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/lpdaac-contact-us/)).

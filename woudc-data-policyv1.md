# Data Use Policy
Use of the WOUDC data are governed by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) data policy and WMO Global Atmosphere 
Watch (GAW) data use policy.
### World Meteorological Organization Data Policy
The WMO facilitates the free and unrestricted exchange of data and information, products and services in real or near-real
 time on matters relating to safety and security of society, economic welfare and the protection of the environment.
Resolution 40 (Cg-XII): WMO policy and practice for the exchange of meteorological and related data and products 
including guidelines on the relationships in commercial meteorological activities.
### Global Atmosphere Watch Data Use Policy
Use of data obtained from one of the WMO GAW World Data Centres (WDC) is subject to the following statement endorsed by the WMO Executive Council and the Commission for Atmospheric Sciences (EC/CAS) panel of experts working group on environmental pollution and atmospheric chemistry [WMO, 2001a]:
WMO Policy Statement
For scientific, educational and policy related use, access to these [GAW] data is unlimited and provided without charge.
By their use you accept that an offer of co-authorship will be made through personal contact with the data providers or
owners whenever substantial use is made of their data. In all cases, an acknowledgment must be made to the data
providers or owners and to the data centre when these data are used within a publication.

### Digital Object Identifiers (DOI)
WOUDC has registered DOIs for both Ozone and UV data. DOIs are persistent identifiers that allow research data to be accessible and citable. They make research data easier to access, reuse and verify, thereby making it easier to build on previous work, conduct new research and avoid duplicating already existing work.

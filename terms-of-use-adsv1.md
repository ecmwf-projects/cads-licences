**Article (3)** **Access**

The ADS or any of its Content may be unavailable from time to time for scheduled maintenance or due to unforeseen circumstances.

**Article (4)** **Licenses**

**Article (6)** **Right to Modification**

ECMWF reserves the right to modify these Terms of Use at any time. Any revised Terms of Use will be posted on the ADS website. Modifications shall take effect immediately following posting of the revised Terms of Use.

**Article (7)** **Discontinuation and Termination**

ECMWF reserves the right, at any time, to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Content as well as any means of accessing or utilizing it at its sole discretion with or without prior notice to users. 

ECMWF may at its sole discretion, under any circumstances, for any or no reason and with or without prior notice to users, suspend or terminate any user’s access to the Content, particularly in cases of violation of these Terms of Use or any of the applicable license terms.

**Article (8)** **Exclusion of Liability and Warranties**

Other than in cases of intentional or grossly negligent breaches of duty by its staff or representatives or claims resting on an injury to life, body or health, neither ECMWF nor the EU shall be responsible or liable to any user of the ADS for any loss or damage of any sort incurred in connection with the use of the ADS.
ECMWF and/or the EU shall also shall not be responsible or liable for the accuracy, usefulness or availability of any Content.

Any Content made available for download or use through or within the ADS is supplied "as is" without further warranties of any kind, either express or implied, including, but not limited to, the quality, performance, merchantability or fitness for a particular use or purpose. Subject to the aforesaid, neither ECMWF nor the EU shall be liable for any damages, including but not limited to direct, indirect, special, incidental, punitive, exemplary or consequential damages arising out of the use of or the inability to use the Content.

ECMWF and the EU disclaim all warranties related to the provision of Content through the ADS.

**Article (9)** **Privileges and Immunities**

Nothing in or relating to these Terms of Use shall be deemed a waiver of any of the privileges and immunities of ECMWF and/or the EU in conformity with their respective Protocols on the Privileges and Immunities.

**Article (10)** **Dispute Settlement**

Any dispute between ECMWF and/or the EU and interested parties arising out of or relating to the use of the ADS or its Content shall be resolved amicably by negotiation. If the dispute cannot be so settled, it shall be finally settled under the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce three arbitrators appointed in accordance with the said rules; sitting in London, England. The proceedings shall be in the English language. The right of appeal by either party to any national courts on a question of law arising in the course of any arbitral proceedings or out of an award made in any arbitral proceedings is hereby agreed to be excluded.

**Article (11)** **Protection of Personal Data**

The Copernicus Data Protection and Privacy Statement applies to all personal data provided by the user in order to register.

**Article (12)** **Severability**

If any provision of these Terms of Use is for any reason held to be invalid, illegal or otherwise unenforceable, such unenforceability does not affect any other provision; the Terms of Use are then to be construed as if they had never contained the provision(s) in question and are to be interpreted, in so far as possible, in such a way as to maintain their original intent.

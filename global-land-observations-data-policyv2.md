**1.    Introduction**

The C3S 311a Lot 2 Global Land and Marine Observations Database service (hereafter, the Service) is undertaken in collaboration with the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration&#39;s National Centre for Environmental Information (NCEI). The aim of the Service is to improve access to, and management of, historical land and marine surface meteorological data holdings. Long-term historical observations allow us to understand past changes and variability in climate, and hence to contextualise projected future changes and their impacts.

Sharing and onward usage policy relating to land surface meteorological data is complex and highly variable depending on the owning country or entity, and in most cases is not clearly associated with the data itself, requiring case by case detailed investigation. Historical changes to network designations, political boundaries, data archives and policy practices further complicate the issue. This means that in the majority of cases there is no immediately clear data policy associated with a station or collection of stations, and significant investigation is required.

**Out of an abundance of caution, the default approach of the Service is to determine data to be restricted to non-commercial usage unless and until a more open policy can be ascertained.**

Modern use of meteorological data is governed by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) policy, practice and guidelines for the exchange of meteorological and related data and products. This is laid out in the following resolutions:

-WMO Unified Data Policy (Resolution 1) of the Extraordinary World Meteorological Congress 2021 – https://wmo.int/wmo-unified-data-policy-resolution-res1, https://wmo.int/news/media-centre/wmo-unified-data-policy-adopted;
-WMO Resolution 60 of the Seventeenth WMO Congress 2015 – https://library.wmo.int/doc_num.php?explnum_id=4192.

The WMO Unified Data Policy (Resolution 1, 2021) has superseded WMO Resolution 40 (1995). Whereas Resolution 40 focused primarily on meteorological data, the Unified Data Policy expands the scope to cover the full range of Earth system data, including weather, climate, hydrology, oceans, the cryosphere, and atmospheric composition.
The Unified Data Policy calls for free and unrestricted international exchange of these data. It mandates this for those datasets designated as Core, which are deemed essential for “services in support of the protection of life and property and the well-being of all nations.” Other datasets are categorized as **_Recommended**_, where Members are strongly encouraged to share data, though with some flexibility in terms of conditions of use.
Thus, the earlier “essential” and “additional” data categories of Resolution 40 are now reflected as “Core” and **_Recommended**_ under the Unified Data Policy. Unlike Resolution 40, which fixed these lists within its annex, the Unified Data Policy ensures that definitions and data requirements are maintained in WMO’s technical regulations, allowing for more adaptive and up-to-date management. This provides greater clarity about the scope of exchange and avoids ambiguities regarding retrospective application or reclassification when stations or networks change their designation.

Some countries have declared an open data policy relating to all their meteorological holdings. However, it is not always clear how this relates to stations located within that country that may have previously been established or operated by another country (e.g. changes in international borders, or data being held by a former colonial state), nor for stations located within other countries that were previously governed by the open data policy country. The hope is that over time more countries will declare their meteorological, climatological, hydrological, and related holdings open. There is currently no definitive single point of reference listing the data policy within each country.

Historical data that pre-dates the electronic exchange era was originally recorded on paper and in many cases remains solely in paper form. Efforts to digitise such data are often undertaken as part of grassroots or international research projects, and the resulting digital data are sometimes made publicly available. It is rare that a clear data policy is attached to these data, but the assumption is that they can be used at a minimum for non-commercial applications as they are already in the public domain. Where digitisation has taken place, the data are not necessarily available under an open data policy.

Daily and monthly meteorological data may be provided directly from the owning country. Therefore, unless it is a CLIMAT designated observation, whereby it comes under the WMO Unified Data Policy’s _**Core**_ category, there may be restrictions on its onward use. In those cases where the C3S Service has derived daily and monthly values from hourly observations, it is not possible to easily retrieve the original hourly observations. However, the hourly observations themselves can be identified and traced. Hence, where those hourly data are not Core and have restrictions placed on their onward use, these restrictions are also determined to pertain to derived daily and monthly values.

The Service is a collation of meteorological observations collected electronically from previously archived international data exchanges (GTS, etc.), individual agreements (with Institutions, NMHSs, etc.) or ad hoc submissions of data collections and data rescue missions. Hence, data policy relating to these holdings includes all of the above scenarios.

**2.    Data Policy Categories Applied in the Present Release**

As noted in the prior section, out of an abundance of caution, in early data releases of the Service, more data than may be necessary are being flagged as being restricted to _**non-commercial**_ use only. This is to avoid raising issues with ultimate data rights holders and any resulting negative impacts on real-time data exchange which, for example, may imperil the provision of operational forecasts. Over successive releases an increasing volume of data will be made available for _**commercial**_ applications once we have a sufficiently documented basis for doing so.

**2.1    Nationally Open Data Policies**

A number of countries have declared their meteorological collections as _**open**_ datasets available to all for unrestricted onwards use cases, including _**commercial**_ activities. Where we are satisfied of this policy at a national level, data will be flagged as _**open**_, and therefore available for _**commercial**_ use applications without restriction. An updated list of _**open**_ data policy countries can be found in Annex A. There will likely be more complicated cases. For example, the ownership of a particular time series or set of data may not be clear because the country instigating the original measurements was not the country where the measurements took place. This will be addressed on a case by case basis as queries arise. Some countries have partial _**open**_ data policies. At present, it is not possible to decipher which stations with the Service the _**open**_ parts cover and so data from these countries remains restricted to _**non-commercial**_ use only. Over time we hope that it becomes easier to decipher which records within a country can be made _**open**_. The data policy for those records will then be amended accordingly. A Global data source contains stations located in many countries and the actual source data policy may not have been verified and will be assumed to be for _**non-commercial**_ use only. However, in this case the stations located in a country that has been verified as having a fully _**open**_ data policy will be listed as _**open**_ access, this has led to some Global data sources containing both _**open**_ access and _**non-commercial**_ data policies. In addition, because of the station merge process some stations may contain segments of data which have derived from a source with open data policy and other segments which come from a source with a _**non-commercial**_ data policy.

**2.2 Pre-Unified Data Policy Adoption (pre-2021)**

Data pre-dating electronic global exchange has mostly come from existing global and national public archives and various significant digitisation efforts (e.g., Atmospheric Circulation Reconstructions over the Earth (ACRE) – met-acre.net, oldweather.org). Such efforts are now supported by the C3S Data Rescue Service and periodically more newly digitised historical data should become available through the C3S Service. Generally, there is no link to source IPR policy documents for such data. Unless otherwise documented, an assumption is made that such data can be used on a _**non-commercial**_ basis only. Sources with a clear open data policy are listed in Annex A.

The data policy applying to data exchanged electronically before the adoption of a formal WMO data policy framework is also unclear. Given that these are not explicitly listed in the Unified Data Policy’s _**Core**_ category, we have interpreted the guidance to mean that these are Recommended and therefore made available on a _**non-commercial**_ basis only. Sources with a clear _**open**_ data policy are listed in Annex A.

**2.3 WMO Unified Data Policy – Core Data**

The Unified Data Policy (Resolution 1, 2021) states that all _**Core**_ data are to be provided on a free and unrestricted basis:

“Members shall provide on a free and unrestricted basis the Core data and products necessary for the provision of services in support of the protection of life and property and the well-being of all nations, particularly those required to describe and forecast accurately weather, climate, water, and other environmental conditions, and to support WMO Programmes.”

Following the technical regulations underpinning the Unified Data Policy (e.g., the WIGOS Manual, GDPFS Manual), any 00, 06, 12, 18Z hours observations from stations identified as part of the Regional Basic Surface Network (RBSN), or CLIMAT reports, are considered to be _**Core**_. These data are therefore available on a free and unrestricted basis, which includes for **_commercial**_ use, and efforts are underway to identify all such reports as open within the Service.

**2.4 WMO Unified Data Policy – Recommended Data**

The Unified Data Policy also encourages Members to provide **_Recommended**_ data and products, which broaden the available global dataset but for which Members retain more flexibility in conditions of use:

“Members should also provide the **_Recommended**_ data and products required to sustain WMO Programmes at the global, regional, and national levels, and, further, as agreed, to assist other Members in the provision of services in their countries. While increasing the volume of data and products available to all Members by providing these **_Recommended**_ data and products, it is understood that Members may place conditions on their re-export or _**commercial**_ use, for reasons such as national laws or costs of production.”

“Members should provide to the research and education communities, for their _**non-commercial**_ activities, free and unrestricted access to all data and products exchanged under the auspices of WMO with the understanding that their commercial activities may be subject to conditions as identified above.”

Hence, any land meteorological data not already identified as Core are considered to be **_Recommended**_ data. These data are therefore available on a free but restricted basis, where only **_non-commercial**_ activities are permitted. They will be identified as **_non-commercial**_ within the Service.

**2.5 Derived Data Values**

In many cases, the Service’s daily and monthly values are derived from hourly and daily data respectively. Although the original values are not retrievable from the averages, they are traceable through the station ID. In line with the WMO Unified Data Policy, derived data should carry the same conditions on their re-export and use as the **_Core**_ or **_Recommended**_ source data from which they originate.

At present, all derived data are made available with restriction to **_non-commercial**_ use only. In the future we will progress this effort such that those daily and monthly averages derived from _**open**_ (i.e., Core, free and unrestricted) sources will be made available as _**open**_.


**3. Policy Queries and Change Process**

There will undoubtedly be cases that arise where data may be accidentally listed under the incorrect data policy category. We have a process to follow in this event, whether it is a user-led change or a Service-detected change.

In the event of a user-discovered query, please contact Copernicus-support@ecmwf.int
 or log in to the C3S Enquiry Portal (https://jira.ecmwf.int/servicedesk/customer/portal/1/user/login?destination=portal%2F1%2Fgroup%2F6%3FgroupId%3D6
). Please state “C3S 311a Lot 2 Data Policy” and describe the issue found with as much detail and documentation as possible.

Where _**open**_ (i.e., **_Core**_) data are queried, they will be withheld while investigation takes place. Any formal change of policy must be supported by sufficient evidence such as the data owner’s written consent or a link to a formal policy document. A copy of these documents will be held by the Service along with the initial query and investigation trail. We aim to resolve all queries within 6 months.

**4. Acknowledgement and Citation Requirements**

All data accessed from the Service will have the relevant acknowledgements and citations attached. We ask that users reproduce these data provider statements whenever their use of the data results in a publication. These are often key for data providers to justify continued provision of observations to their funders. For example, Met Éireann (Irish Met Service) state that all users acknowledge them when using their data:

&quot;Under the CC-BY-SA Licence, users must acknowledge Met Éireann as the source of the data by inserting this attribution statement in their product or application: Contains Met Éireann Data licensed&quot;

Data acknowledgements and citations requirements are the responsibility of the user. Users agree to use acknowledgments and citations in any application that uses the data provided. The list of citations is found in the documentation tab.

There is no additional formal requirement to cite or acknowledge the Service although relevant papers and documentation are available through the CDS documentation tab and are citeable should the user wish to do so.

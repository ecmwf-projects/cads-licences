The NOAA CDR Program’s official distribution point for CDRs is NOAA’s National Climatic Data Center which provides sustained, open access and active data management of the CDR packages and related information in keeping with the United States’ open data policies and practices as described in the President's Memorandum on "Open Data Policy" and pursuant to the Executive Order of May 9, 2013, "Making Open and Machine Readable the New Default for Government Information". In line with these policies, the CDR data sets are non- proprietary, publicly available, and no restrictions are placed upon their use.
